# GitHub Dispatch Webhook

A lightweight Cloudflare Workers implementation for triggering GitHub repository dispatch events. This webhook service provides a simple and secure way to trigger GitHub Actions workflows remotely.

## Features

- Serverless implementation using Cloudflare Workers
- Minimal configuration required
- Secure GitHub token handling
- Customizable repository targeting
- Easy to deploy and maintain

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account
- GitHub account with repository access
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Fork and Configure Repository
1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/lirtual/github-dispatch-webhook/fork) by clicking the 'Fork' button in the top-right corner
2. Go to your forked repository's settings
3. Navigate to 'Secrets and variables' â†’ 'Actions'
4. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
   - `REPO_PATH`: Your target repository path (e.g., `your-username/your-repo`)

### 2. Setup Cloudflare Worker
1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages
3. Create a new Worker
4. Copy the content from `src/worker.js` to your new Worker
5. Add Environment Variables in your Worker settings:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
   - `REPO_PATH`: Your target repository path

### 3. Deploy and Test
1. Deploy your Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Test the webhook by sending a POST request to your Worker URL:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-dispatch-webhook.git
cd github-dispatch-webhook
```

### 2. Install Wrangler CLI
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
In your Cloudflare Workers dashboard, set the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
- `REPO_PATH`: Repository path in format `owner/repo` (e.g., `ray-workspace/cognideep_server`)

### 4. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```bash
wrangler publish
```

## Usage

Send a POST request to your worker's URL to trigger a repository dispatch event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

The worker will send a repository dispatch event to the configured GitHub repository with the event type "deploy".

## Configuration

### wrangler.toml
```toml
name = "github-dispatch-webhook"
main = "src/worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2023-01-01"

[vars]
# Default repository path (can be overridden by environment variables)
REPO_PATH = "owner/repo"
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your GitHub token to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Consider implementing additional authentication for the webhook endpoint
- Regularly rotate your GitHub token

## Development

To run locally:
```bash
wrangler dev
```
